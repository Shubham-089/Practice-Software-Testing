## Introduction
This test plan aims to define the testing strategy, scope,
objectives, resources, and schedule for testing the Practice
Software Testing website. The goal is to ensure the platform
meets functional, performance, usability, and security
requirements.

---

## Objectives
The key objectives of the test plan are:
1. Validate the functional correctness of the website.
2. Verify that all features (e.g., user registration, login, test
simulations) work as intended.
3. Test non-functional aspects like usability, performance, and
compatibility.
4. Identify and report defects to ensure the website is bug-free.
5. Confirm that the website meets business and user requirements.
6. Validate the website on multiple browsers, devices, and
operating systems
---

## Scope
The testing process covers:
● Functional Testing (e.g., User Registration, Login, Navigation).
● UI/UX Testing (e.g., layout, design consistency).
● Cross-Browser and Cross-Device Testing.
● Performance Testing (e.g., response time, load testing).
● Security Testing (e.g., authentication, user data protection).
● Regression Testing.
